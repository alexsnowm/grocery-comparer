# Grocery Comparer
### Description
A web app that tells you where the cheapest groceries are. Users enter in items - like Ziploc gallon bags - they want to keep a record for, and add prices from different stores for an item as well as the unit of measure - such as a pack of 40 bags - those prices are for. The app can then show the lowest number per unit and what store offers that.

### Languages and Technologies
This project is written in Java and uses the Spring MVC framework, Hibernate for ORM, and Thymeleaf for templating. MySQL is used for the database, and Gradle is used to build the app.

### Future Features
- Create offline shopping lists: Users can select items to be included on a list that can be exported to a printer-friendly PDF, or sent as a formatted email to the userâ€™s default email address or another address of their choosing.
- User login: Users can create and login to their account and enter a default email address for their account. Each account has its own set of items and stores with information entered and edited only by the user of that account.
- Sort by distance: Users can display only items available at stores within an inputted distance from users' current location.
